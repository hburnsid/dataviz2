# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt
Explore the different ways to examine worldwide debt through different data visualizations. 

## Bar Chart Visualization

## Spark Chart Visualization

This chart visualizes the worldwide Debt-to-GDP ratio. Each country is listed side by side to compare which countires are have a lower ratio, and therefore less overall debt, which usually indicates an economically functioning country.

## Heatmap Visualization

These different visualizations represent how the same data can tell a story in multiple ways. The first data set is simple and easily understood as it uses color very sparingly. But this data only represents a single year which does not show the trends in GDP over time, which is not a complete story. The second visualization does a better job of showing the trends over time but visually is very demanding cognitively for a viewer. The number of graphs next to one another requires the viewer to look back and forth to compare the trends over time across countries. The third visualization overcomes this issue by bringing all the countires together to ease the ability to compare the trends over time. The gradient also helps the viewer to understand the historical trends and whether or not the trend signifies something good or bad.
